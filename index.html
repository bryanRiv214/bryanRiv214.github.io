                        Hello all! I'm Bryan and I'm currently 18 years old. <br>I'm a senior at Brooklyn Technical High School and like passing the time with video games, books, and spending time with my two little brothers.
                        <br><br>I'm an aspiring Computer Scientist and have experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, UNIX, and more.
                    <br> My mission is to pay it forward. I want to give back to the people and communities that gave so much to me.

                            This was an early project I made during my time at All-Star Code. The project is simple, the ball would
                            go in a straight line until it reached the end of the canvas and then return from a different position. This
                            proccess would then loop. <br></br>While it may not seem significant, this was the first instance in which I was exposed to the p5 library.
                            I recall that I wanted to learn and grow more as a programmer. At this moment, I was certain that I wanted to pursue a career in Computer Science.

                        This was the last project I completed at my time at ASC. The goal of <b>Partype</b> was for it to be a new and more efficient alternative 
                        to party-planning. The structure and functionality of <b>Partype</b> was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and APIs. Additionally, <b>Partype</b> was presented in front
                        of ASC and Goldman Sachs staff.
                        This project wouldn't have been possible without my trusted partners, Ralph Davis and Storm Rivera.

                        <b>Picture Puzzle</b> is a project I completed during my Junior year at Brooklyn Technical High School. The premise of <b>Picture Puzzle</b> is that
                        the user must unscramble a picture by swapping two pictures at a time and achieve the lowest score possible. The program utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
                        This project was extremely meaningful as it taught me how to manipulate the elements of a wesbite.
